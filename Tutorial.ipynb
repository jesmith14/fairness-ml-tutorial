    "For companies that use classification based predictors, sometimes the predicted outcome of individuals within a group will fully influence the decision that is made for that individual. This needs to be treated particularly carefully when the decision being made is a <i>Social Benefit</i> - ie) health care, loan approval, or college admission. What if the data that is being used to train the model is inherently discriminatory? What if factors that created the data we use was inherently discriminatory and we didn't even know? Then the outcome predicted would also be discriminatory.<br/><br/>\n",
    "This is what non-discriminatory predictors seek to solve. While there are many models to use, we will be focusing on <b>The Equal Opportunity Model</b>. This means, for each group - the true positive rate is the same. What does this mean in terms of performance for binary classifiers? (Write in terms of 1's an 0's below)"

    "## Part 1: A Brief Introduction to Non-Discriminatory Machine Learning Models\n",
    "For companies that use classification based machine learning models, sometimes the predicted outcome of individuals will fully influence the decision that is made for that individual. This needs to be treated particularly carefully when the decision being made is a <i>Social Benefit</i> - ie) health care, loan approval, or college admission. What if the data that is being used to train the model is inherently discriminatory? What if factors that created the data we use was inherently discriminatory? Then the outcome predicted would also be discriminatory.<br/><br/>\n",
    "This is what non-discriminatory models seek to solve. While there are many models to use, we will be focusing on <b>The Equal Opportunity Model</b>. This means, for each group - the true positive rate is the same."
